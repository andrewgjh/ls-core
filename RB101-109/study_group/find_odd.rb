# Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

# There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
# Examples

# [7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).
# [0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).
# [1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

=begin

INPUT is an array of integers
OUTPUT is an integer representing the integer that occured an odd number of times

ALGO 
use group_by to get the array into a hash map

use find method on the hash map to return the key where the value .size is odd
